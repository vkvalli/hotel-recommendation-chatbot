# Hotel recommendation Chatbot

The Hotel Recommendation Chatbot is an interactive Python-based chatbot that helps users find top hotels based on reviews in their desired city. The chatbot utilizes a dataset containing hotel listings and reviews across 25 cities, offering various features such as semantic search, recommender system, sentiment analysis, graph network for similar hotels, and hotel segmentation based on reviews.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of hotel listings and reviews from 25 different cities. It provides valuable information for natural language processing (NLP) projects such as semantic search, recommender systems, sentiment analysis, graph network analysis, and hotel segmentation.

## Functionality
The Hotel recommendation Chatbot offers the following functionality:

City Selection: Users are prompted to enter the city they wish to stay in.

Top Hotel Recommendations: Based on the number of reviews, the chatbot suggests a list of the top 10 hotels in the selected city.

Recommender System: The chatbot recommends hotels based on user preferences or similarity to previously reviewed hotels.

## Future Enhancements
Integration with external APIs to provide real-time hotel data and availability.
Natural Language Understanding (NLU) capabilities to improve user interaction and understand complex queries.
Incorporation of machine learning techniques for better hotel recommendations based on user preferences.
Deployment of the chatbot as a web application or integration with messaging platforms for wider accessibility.
